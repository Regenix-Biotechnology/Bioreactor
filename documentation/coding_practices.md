# Coding Guidelines

This document establishes standard programming rules to ensure consistency, improve code quality, and facilitate collaboration within the team.

## 1. Git Rules

- When fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or making changes, **create a new branch** from the `main` branch.
- This helps avoid conflicts and keeps the `main` branch clean.
- After completing your work, **create a pull request (PR)** to merge your branch into `main`.
- At least **one team member must review your code** before merging.

## 2. Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes the code easier to read and maintain. Follow these conventions:

- **camelCase** → For variables, functions, and methods.  
- **PascalCase** → For class names.  
- **UPPERCASE** → For constants.  
- **snake_case** → For file names.
- **Boolean variables** should start with `is`, `has`, `can`, etc.  
  _Example:_ `isAvailable`, `hasPermission`, `canExecute`

Following these rules will help maintain clarity and improve collaboration across the team.

## 3. Documentation

Feel free to add sections in this guide to document any new rules or practices that you think are important for the team.
